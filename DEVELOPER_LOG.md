## 2025-02-15 - Initial Docker Configuration Planning

**Task**: Initial Setup
**Status**: In Progress

### Progress
- Project initialized with focus on minimal, reliable Docker configuration
- Requirements identified:
  - WordPress with Apache
  - MySQL
  - Coolify deployment target
- Development standards established in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Created initial docker-compose.yml with:
  - WordPress 6.4 with Apache
  - MySQL 8.0 with native password authentication
  - Volume mounts for data persistence

### Technical Decisions
- Using official WordPress image with Apache for simplicity
- Minimal container configuration to reduce complexity
- Coolify's Traefik integration handles port mapping

### Next Steps
1. Test basic deployment
2. Validate WordPress installation
3. Document Coolify deployment process

### Future Enhancements
- Optimize PHP and MySQL settings
- Implement backup strategy

## Development Workflow Notes
- 2025-02-17: NO LOCAL TESTING - All testing is done directly in Coolify production environment

## 2025-02-17 - Adding Redis Object Caching

**Task**: #10
**Status**: In Progress

### Progress
- Added Redis service to docker-compose.yaml with:
  - 128MB memory limit
  - LRU eviction policy
  - Persistence enabled via appendonly
  - Volume mount for data persistence
- Configured WordPress to use Redis via environment variables:
  - WP_REDIS_HOST and WP_REDIS_PORT
  - Enabled WP_CACHE

### Technical Decisions
- Using Redis 7 for latest features and performance
- LRU eviction policy to automatically manage memory
- Persistence enabled to maintain cache across restarts
- 128MB memory limit as a reasonable starting point

### Next Steps
1. Deploy to Coolify for testing
2. Verify Redis connection
3. Monitor cache performance

### Coolify Learnings
- Created CBP.md to document Coolify best practices
- Removed unnecessary volume declarations (Coolify handles automatically)
- Confirmed no port mappings needed (handled by Traefik)

## 2025-02-17 - MySQL LTS Upgrade

**Task**: #12
**Status**: In Progress

### Progress
- Attempting direct upgrade from MySQL 8 to 8.4.4 LTS
- Updated docker-compose.yaml with mysql:8.4.4 image

### Technical Decisions
- Chose direct upgrade path (8 â†’ 8.4.4) because:
  - Fresh WordPress install (no existing data to migrate)
  - MySQL 8.4.4 is an LTS release focused on stability
  - WordPress has good MySQL version compatibility
  - Docker image changes mainly affect initialization/configuration

### Next Steps
1. Test deployment in Coolify
2. Verify WordPress database connection
3. Monitor for any initialization issues

## 2025-02-17 - Adding WP-CLI Support

**Task**: #14
**Status**: In Progress

### Progress
- Added WP-CLI as a separate service in docker-compose.yaml:
  - Using wordpress:cli-php8.2 image
  - Shared volume with WordPress container
  - Database connection configuration
  - Proper service dependencies

### Technical Decisions
- Implemented as separate service rather than in WordPress container for:
  - Better separation of concerns
  - Independent scaling
  - Cleaner configuration
- Using cli-php8.2 variant to match WordPress PHP version
- Added proper dependencies to ensure WordPress and MySQL are ready

### Next Steps
1. Deploy to Coolify for testing
2. Verify WP-CLI functionality
3. Document common commands in README.md
