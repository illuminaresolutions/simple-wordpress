## 2025-02-15 - Initial Docker Configuration Planning

**Task**: Initial Setup
**Status**: In Progress

### Progress
- Project initialized with focus on creating minimal, performant Docker configuration
- Requirements identified:
  - PHP 8.2 with PHP-FPM
  - MySQL
  - Redis for caching
  - Coolify deployment target with Traefik integration
- Development standards established in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Created initial docker-compose.yml with:
  - WordPress running on PHP 8.2-FPM
  - MySQL 8.0 with native password authentication
  - Redis 7 with persistence enabled
  - Volume mounts for data persistence
  - WordPress configured with Redis integration
- Added optimized PHP-FPM configuration:
  - Dynamic process manager with tuned settings
  - Memory limit set to 256M
  - Increased upload limits to 64M
  - Configured logging to Docker stdout/stderr
  - Set appropriate user permissions
- Configured MySQL for optimal WordPress performance:
  - Added initialization script for database setup
  - Increased max_allowed_packet to 64M
  - Set InnoDB buffer pool size to 1GB
  - Optimized InnoDB log settings
  - Configured for better write performance
- Optimized Redis configuration:
  - Set memory limit to 256MB
  - Configured LRU eviction policy
  - Enabled AOF persistence with optimized settings
  - Tuned for WordPress object caching
  - Added RDB snapshots for backup

### Technical Decisions
- Using PHP-FPM for optimal performance
- Redis integration for object caching
- Minimal container configuration to reduce complexity
- Coolify's Traefik integration handles port mapping

### Next Steps
1. Create base Docker configuration:
   - Create docker-compose.yml for local development
   - Configure PHP 8.2 with FPM
   - Set up MySQL container
   - Integrate Redis
2. Implement WordPress configuration
3. Test and validate performance
4. Document deployment process for Coolify

### Open Questions
- Optimal Redis configuration for WordPress caching
- Backup strategy for MySQL data
- Development workflow for local testing
