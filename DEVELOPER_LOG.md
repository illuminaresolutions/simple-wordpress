## 2025-02-15 - Initial Docker Configuration Planning

**Task**: Initial Setup
**Status**: In Progress

### Progress
- Project initialized with focus on creating minimal, performant Docker configuration
- Requirements identified and implemented:
  - WordPress with Apache (initial setup)
  - MySQL 8.0 for database
  - Redis 7 for object caching
  - Coolify deployment target with Traefik integration

### Implementation Milestones
1. Base Configuration (Complete):
   - WordPress 6.4 with Apache
   - MySQL 8.0 with native password authentication
   - Volume mounts for data persistence
   - Successful Coolify deployment
   - Verified WordPress installation

2. Redis Integration (Complete):
   - Added Redis 7 with 128MB memory limit
   - Configured LRU eviction policy
   - Enabled AOF persistence
   - Tested with WordPress Redis Object Cache plugin
   - Verified caching functionality

3. PHP-FPM Optimization (In Progress):
   - Switched from Apache to Nginx 1.25-alpine
   - Replaced WordPress Apache with PHP-FPM image
   - Added optimized Nginx configuration:
     * FastCGI tuning
     * Gzip compression
     * Static file caching
   - Configured PHP-FPM:
     * Dynamic process management
     * OPcache optimizations
     * WordPress-specific settings

### Technical Decisions
- Started with Apache-based WordPress for initial stability
- Added Redis caching for performance optimization
- Switching to Nginx + PHP-FPM for better resource utilization
- Using Coolify's Traefik integration for port mapping

### Current Status
- Main branch: Stable configuration with Redis caching
- feat/nginx-php-fpm: PHP-FPM implementation ready for testing
- All changes documented and version controlled
- Incremental improvements maintaining stability

### Next Steps
1. Test PHP-FPM implementation:
   - Deploy feat/nginx-php-fpm branch
   - Verify WordPress functionality
   - Confirm Redis integration still works
   - Test static file serving
2. Measure performance improvements
3. Document deployment process for Coolify

### Open Questions
- Performance metrics to validate PHP-FPM benefits
- Optimal Nginx caching strategies
- Development workflow for local testing

## 2025-02-16 - Nginx Configuration Structure Fix

**Task**: Issue #7
**Status**: In Progress

### Progress
- Fixed Nginx configuration mounting issue in Coolify:
  1. Restructured Nginx configuration:
     - Created conf.d directory
     - Moved nginx.conf to conf.d/default.conf
     - Updated docker-compose.yml to mount directory
  2. Improved Docker compatibility:
     - Following best practices for config mounting
     - Preserving container filesystem structure
     - Using read-only mounts for security

### Technical Decisions
- Mount entire conf.d directory instead of single file
- Use standard Nginx configuration structure
- Maintain separation of configuration files
- Follow Docker volume mounting best practices

### Current Status
- feat/php-fpm-optimization: Nginx configuration structure fixed
- Containers start successfully in Coolify
- 502 error persists with PHP-FPM communication

### Next Steps
1. Debug PHP-FPM communication:
   - Review PHP-FPM logs
   - Verify process listening on port 9000
   - Check container networking
   - Validate FastCGI configuration
2. Document findings and solutions
3. Test WordPress functionality once fixed

### Open Questions
- PHP-FPM and Nginx communication in Coolify environment
- Container networking configuration needs
- Logging and monitoring requirements
