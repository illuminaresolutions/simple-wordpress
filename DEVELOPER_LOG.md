## 2025-02-15 - Initial Docker Configuration Planning

**Task**: Initial Setup
**Status**: In Progress

### Progress
- Project initialized with focus on minimal, reliable Docker configuration
- Requirements identified:
  - WordPress with Apache
  - MySQL
  - Coolify deployment target
- Development standards established in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Created initial docker-compose.yml with:
  - WordPress 6.4 with Apache
  - MySQL 8.0 with native password authentication
  - Volume mounts for data persistence

### Technical Decisions
- Using official WordPress image with Apache for simplicity
- Minimal container configuration to reduce complexity
- Coolify's Traefik integration handles port mapping

### Next Steps
1. Test basic deployment
2. Validate WordPress installation
3. Document Coolify deployment process

### Future Enhancements
- Add Redis for object caching
- Optimize PHP and MySQL settings
- Implement backup strategy
